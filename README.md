# ComfyUI Menu Anchor
This is an Extension for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), which moves the menu to the specified corner on startup.

## But Why
If you also install a bunch of Extensions that add buttons to the menu like me, half of the buttons are basically out of the screen on launch.

This helps solving that... *"problem."*

## Configs
You can click the cog icon to open the settings, and use the **Menu Anchor Mode** to select which corner to snap to, as well as enabling **Menu Anchor Always** to make it always stick to the corner.

> Requires refresh (`F5`) to take effect
